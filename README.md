# Backend Project - Java Spring (faircorp)

```Shreyas HARINATH - CPS2-M1 (UJM)```

### Main Feature

This project provides multiple useful REST API's that can be used to manage entities such as windows, heaters and rooms in a building.

-----

### Why this app?

The management of the sanitary conditions (COVID-19 pandemic, pollution), user comfort, and energy efficiency, require concurrent management of window openings in the Ã‰cole des Mines buildings. It is necessary to ventilate as much as possible to limit the spread of the cirus and air pollution in general, but as winter approaches it will become important to heat the buildings to ensure user comfort.
